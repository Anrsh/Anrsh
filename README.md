# Hi there!
My name is Daniel, (You can call me Dany), I'm studying ICT.

Currently, I want to learn **Node.js** to become *backend* developer (maybe fullstack in the future). I'm learning from freecodecamp rn, and want to focus on Discord bots for practice.

Have some ideas in mind, I will work with open sources projects when my skill will be on accaptable level.

## Current projects WiP:
- Soon™

## Finished (for now) projects:
